\subsection{Description of the Grounding Concept}
Rear wing is not grounded, there is no \gls{ts} nor \gls{glvs} electronics within 100mm range.
Front and side wings are grounded with wires that are connected to their (metal) mounting screws and \gls{glvs} ground.
Steering wheel is grounded using wire connected to \gls{glvs} ground.

\subsection{Grounding Measurements}
To verify, that our grounding concept is compliant with rules, we are using 4 point resistance measurement method between parts and \gls{glvs} ground with current power supply to ensure resistance below 5 \ohm.
