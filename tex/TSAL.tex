\subsubsection{Description / circuitry}
% Describe the tractive system active light and additional circuitry. Additionally, fill out the table:

Our TSAL system consists of two parts, LEDs and generator of frequency with power-switch. Generator is in ECUB protected by fuse. The waveform is generated with a 555-based circuit. The TSAL uses pairs of anti-parallel LEDs and is connected with two wires. Color of the light is decided by the polarity of the driving voltage. The following table shows the operation mode depending on conditions C1, C2:

\paragraph{Explanation of TSAL circuit}

Left top corner of \ref{fig:TSAL-HV} (input marked as HV-Viper) is directly connected to the output HV pins of ACP. The circuit is designed with STM chip „VIPER16HN“. It behaves as normal fly-back, with input voltage range from 50V up to 500V. Output of flyback is used to directly power the TSAL. ACP indication led is powered from primary side of transformer. To ensure correct behaviour, we also measure and compare input voltage (using U12A OAMP as comparator with little hysteresis), to enable output (Q36 \& Q33) only if input voltage is >=60VDC.

\end{figure}

Function of circuit on \ref{fig:TSAL-enable} is that the TSAL is enabled even when the 60VDC limit is not reached, but the AIR is closed nonetheless. In such state, the TSAL is enabled by signal AIR\_EN. The circuit is powered by MAIN24 power (which is equal to the 24V enabled by GLVMS) or by the TSAL\_ACP-EN power signal from the Viper-TSAL schematic (\ref{fig:TSAL-ACPindicator}) below.
