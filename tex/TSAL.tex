\subsubsection{Description / circuitry}
% Describe the tractive system active light and additional circuitry. Additionally, fill out the table:

The TSAL is a distributed system consisting of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tractive System Active Light mounted on main hoop
\item TSAL logic \& power circuitry (located in ECU-B; LV only)
\item DC-DC converter to power the TSAL in case of charged TS but unpowered GLVS (located in the ACP; has a HV side and a LV side)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Tractive System Active Light}

The TSAL proper is connected with 2 wires. When voltage of 24 V is applied, the TSAL lights up either in green or red color depending on the polarity.

\paragraph{TSAL logic \& power circuitry}

To power the TSAL, a voltage of approximately 24 V is needed. This can be supplied either by the GLVS, or by a charged Tractive System by means of an isolated DC-DC converter.

A 5V rail is also generated to control all TSAL-related logic. (\ref{fig:TSAL-ECUB-5V})

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./img/TSAL-ECUB-5V.png}
	\caption[Powering of the TSAL]{Powering of the TSAL. GLVS power is denoted \texttt{VCC}.}
	\label{fig:TSAL-ECUB-5V}
\end{figure}

Discrete logic is used for selecting the light colour. (\ref{fig:TSAL-logic})

	\label{fig:TSAL-logic}
\end{figure}

A 555 IC is used to generate the required frequency which is used to modulate the power output. (\ref{fig:TSAL-555})

\end{figure}

Finally, a H-bridge is used to drive the proper power outputs with switchable polarity. (\ref{fig:TSAL-H-bridge})

\paragraph{DC-DC converter}

To ensure that the TSAL continues to operate even after disabling GLVS, the following circuit is used:

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Explanation of TSAL circuit}

TODO TODO JSix Patrik Left top corner of \ref{fig:TSAL-HV} (input marked as HV-Viper) is directly connected to the output HV pins of ACP. The circuit is designed with STM chip „VIPER16HN“. It behaves as normal fly-back, with input voltage range from 50V up to 500V. Output of flyback is used to directly power the TSAL. ACP indication led is powered from primary side of transformer. To ensure correct behaviour, we also measure and compare input voltage (using U12A OAMP as comparator with little hysteresis), to enable output (Q36 \& Q33) only if input voltage is >=60VDC.

	\caption{TSAL enable scheme}
	\label{fig:TSAL-enable}
\end{figure}

Function of circuit on \ref{fig:TSAL-enable} is that the TSAL is enabled even when the 60VDC limit is not reached, but the AIR is closed nonetheless. In such state, the TSAL is enabled by signal AIR\_EN. The circuit is powered by MAIN24 power (which is equal to the 24V enabled by GLVMS) or by the TSAL\_ACP-EN power signal from the Viper-TSAL schematic (\ref{fig:TSAL-ACPindicator}) below.
