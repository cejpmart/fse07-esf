\subsubsection{Description/circuitry}
\iffalse Describe the concept and circuitry of the Shutdown System Interlocks.
Note: Interlocks are circuits used to open the shutdown circuit if a connector is disconnected or enclosure is opened.  This is not the entire shutdown circuit.\fi

We have interlocks in ACP HV connector (connector HV\_A), Motor controller HV inputs and outputs, HV connector in Service box, HVD and in the LV connectors from MCÂ´s (MCR and MCF) to motor (connectors M1, M2, M3 and M4). 

In all HV connectors and LV connectors to motors we have a loop, that in case of disconnection from car opens Shutdown circuit.

\subsubsection{Wiring/cables/connectors}
%Describe wiring, show schematics, describe connectors and cables used and show useful data regarding the wiring.

Scheme of entire Shutdown circuit can be found at \ref{fig:SDC-scheme}.

\subsubsection{Position in car}
%Provide CAD-renderings showing the relevant parts. Mark the parts in the rendering, if necessary.
HVD is clearly shown above in \ref{fig:SDC-positionInCar}. For Service box position see \ref{fig:ServiceBox-position}

Last interlock is in Accumulator Pack HV Connector shown in ACP HV Connector.
