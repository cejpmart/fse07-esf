\subsubsection{Description (type, operation parameters)}
%Describe the IMD used and use a table for the common operation parameters, like supply voltage, set point, etc. Also, describe how the \gls{imd} indicator light is wired, etc.
%Additionally, fill out the following table replacing the values with your specification

We use A-ISOMETERÂ® IR155-3203 \Acrfull{imd} for unearthed DC drive systems. Our maximum tractive voltage is 403.2 \vdc. The rules require minimal insulation value between \gls{ts} and \gls{glvs} 500 \ohm/V. Minimal resistance value for our car is $408*500 = 204 000$ \ohm. This was set as request for manufacturer, and device was programmed in factory.

	\caption{Parameters of the \gls{imd}}
	\begin{tabu}{|X|l|}
	 \hline	Supply voltage range: & 10 to 36 \vdc \\
	 \hline	Supply voltage & 24 \vdc \\
	 \hline	Environmental temperature range: & -40 to 105 \degC \\
	 \hline	Selftest interval: & Always at startup, then every 5 minutes \\
	 \hline	High voltage range: & 0 to 1000 \vdc \\
	 \hline	Set response value: & 204 k\ohm (500 \ohm/Volt) \\
	 \hline	Max. operation current: & 150 mA \\
	 \hline	Approximate time to shut down at 50\% of the response value: & 20 s \\

\subsubsection{Wiring/cables/connectors/}
%Describe wiring, show schematics, describe connectors and cables used and show useful data regarding the wiring including wire gauge/temp/voltage rating and fuses protecting the wiring. 

Relay of \gls{imd} is electrically placed between \gls{mcf} and relay for \gls{ams} measurement. Wiring is done using Raychem Spec44 wire, AWG 22, rated to 600V. Wiring is shown on \ref{fig:SDC-scheme}. \gls{imd} opens relay in case of fault. \gls{imd} have output for relay, so there is not necessary adding zero diode on output. \gls{hv} input to \gls{imd} is connected in according to datasheet.
